As of now: 
Copy the HW_Toolkit folder to your Blender/scripts/addons/ folder. Turn on the Homeworld Remastered Toolkit in the addons in Blender.


Alternatively: place the repo in "C:\Users\@@@\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.74\scripts\addons"
Then run the script "__init__.py" from the Blender text editor to enable.

No enabling of script required; however script must be run every time you want to use it - upside is you can recieve latest changes without having to copy scripts to new location. Recommend opening the text editor in a panel and pressing "Ctrl U" to save current panels/objects etc. as default blender startup (note, script must be reopened every time - as a startup file does not load changes in .py file).
