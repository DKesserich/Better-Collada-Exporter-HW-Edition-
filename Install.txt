Set your Scripts folder (Blender: File > User Preferences > File), to the location of this repository on your computer.

Note: Do NOT set the folder to the "addons" folder within the repo; this will stop the scripts from being found.


Alternatively, place the HW_Toolkit folder in your Scripts folder.
