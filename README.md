# HW Remastered Toolkit for Blender
Blender add-on for creating content for Homeworld: Remastered.

Contains a custom Collada export script that exports DAE files compatible with the HODOR tools, and automated creation tools for ship hardpoints and LOD nodes. 

I claim no copyright to this version.
